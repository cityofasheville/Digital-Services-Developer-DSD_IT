Based on your resume and cover letter, we think you fit several of the above listed qualifications, and we are excited to learn more about your skill set.

## Show us what you've got!

Do you have an online portfolio that could be kicked our way?  Perhaps references to working sites or an app that you had a hand in developing?  It would be great if you could share what you already have available with us, and throw some context around it - if was a team effort, let us know which parts you helped out on.

## Or, show us what you can do

Are you new to the game and don’t yet have anything publically available?  Not to worry!  Asheville is all about open data - and this means we’re providing links to interesting, real-world datasets that can be used to spin something up to demonstrate your skills.

Do you just love geeking out on data and want to do a mashup for fun?  We won’t stop you from doing that, either!  Want to mod something the city offers today?  Cool by us.  If you want to go one of these routes, here are some links to get you started:

* Asheville’s open data site with useful APIs:
  * http://data.ashevillenc.gov/
* A Development Services Department specific dataset and the beta dashboard that it feeds into:	
  * http://data.ashevillenc.gov/datasets?q=sla 
  * http://simplicity2.ashevillenc.gov/development/sla-dashboard
* Another Development Services Department dashboard site - work in progress:
  * http://citygovapp.com/asheville_analytics/permits/view_permits.htm
* Asheville’s shiny, new, go-to dashboards:
  * http://dashboards.ashevillenc.gov/capital_projects  
  * http://dashboards.ashevillenc.gov/budget
  * http://dashboards.ashevillenc.gov/homelessness

## Rules

* If you elect to create something new, keep it simple. We are not looking for a finished product, but want to learn a little more about your skills and how you approach problems. Think of your delivery as something "minimal" that is on the road to awesome.
* You may email us with any questions, or, preferably, use this repo's issues.

## Deliverables

* Portfolio or Demo project

We’re all about efficiency here, and your time is valuable.  You decide the best way to convey your skills to us, and we look forward to being dazzled by you!

## Basic Info on Site ##
This portfolio was designed and implemented in 2014 for myself to try to obtain new jobs and find freelance work.

It has recently been updated (October 2017) to include some examples that use public APIs and also some small color and image changes. Not much else.

Please check out the very first project (I moved this one to the front), as it utilizes some public information that I went through and pushed into a consumable format.

#### Some Warnings ####
This does not encompass all the work that I do or have done over the last 3 years. A majority of my work has been done with a signed non disclosure agreement.

I also do not yet have a section that includes my design nor art work that could actually be quite useful to an employer or client.
