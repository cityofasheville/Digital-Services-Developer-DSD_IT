Thank you; I have had fun playing with your data this week. I created two projects in ReactJS.

Urban Trail Asheville, NC [http://wax9.com/publicart](http://wax9.com/publicart)
[https://github.com/bitslayer42/publicart](https://github.com/bitslayer42/publicart)

Asheville Purchase Order Calendar [http://wax9.com/purch-ord/](http://wax9.com/purch-ord/)
[https://github.com/bitslayer42/purch-ord](https://github.com/bitslayer42/purch-ord)

I also made a home page to tie those and some other projects together.
